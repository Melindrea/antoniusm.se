title: "January 2017: A new start"
---

## Dear friends,

A new year, and a new start! I'm not planning on doing much of changes, but I've setup a few writing goals (which you can [find on my site](https://antoniusm.se/blog/2017/)). I'm planning on making this year the year that I finally publish something and not just talk about!

Now to last months writing plans:

* I did update [Stockholm Sentinels](https://tablo.io/melindrea/stockholm-sentinels) with a new chapter, which takes the teaser from last month and a bit more
* I haven't had time to give Helga her final revision, but I've decided that my main novel focus will be on her story, so that's actually a goal for January
* I haven't had time to look over my stories from the writing class, but I think there's some really nice ones in the pile, and the teacher was very encouraging (to the extent of expression surprise that I hadn't taken writing classes before her)

### Writing plans

* Continue updating Stockholm Sentinels
* Finish the first act of Last Priestess of Ran
* Setup a plan for revising Angel Maker

### Teaser

Here's a bit from Helga's story, when she tries to convince a friend of her father to help her.

<blockquote>

“That sounds like a fool’s errand, Helga Yngvesdotter”  Guthorm set his mug down on the granite-topped table. “You can stay here with me. I will protect you from the King’s men, should they return.” He removed his felted cap and set it down. “Or we can go somewhere else. I owe it to your father to keep you safe.” He held out a hand to her. “What do you say?”

It was really tempting: surrender to it and let him take care of her life. She twirled a coil of black hair around her finger and the stench of the pyre invaded her nose. How long was it since she had bathed? Being thrown into the ocean, twice, did not count. The weight of her people lay on her shoulder. To share that burden with someone else who could understand it. But if she did, he would do what he could to keep her safe, and that would include stopping her from seeking retribution. And if she returned with a husband, Fjalar would never accept her as her father’s heir. It had been hard enough to convince him to give her a chance in the direct aftermath of the slaughter.

“Thank you.” She shook her head and dug her heels into the earth floor to steady herself. “But I cannot accept it. I owe my father and my people the dignity of being avenged, and if you will not help me, then I will find someone else who will.”

“You are as beautiful as your mother was.” He sighed and shook his head. “But it is your father and his unbendable will I see in your eyes.” He scratched at the back of his neck. “I was a fool for following him.” He flashed a grin of browning teeth and red gums. “And I will be the same fool for you.”
