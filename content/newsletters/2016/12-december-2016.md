## Dear friends,

Even more things have changed since the last newsletter back in February (you didn't think I had forgotten about you, did you?). The job I loved took up all my time, and then it didn't: they were out of money, so I had to scramble to get a new job! Thankfully, I found a new job quickly, and while it's not as free as the last job was (where I worked from home and could decide my own schedule), I like working there. I have good people to work with, and sitting at the office means I get more people around me. And bonus: while it's got some travel time, it's only 25 minute train + 20 minute walk, which simplifies things.

I promised a cover reveal last time, and while this was posted back in March, here's [the post I did](https://antoniusm.se/blog/revising-angelmaker/) that showed the cover and a bit of revision.

What else has been going on? Well, I've been taking a writing course in Swedish, regarding myths and fairy tales, and how to work them into my writing. I can't share anything from that since, as established, it's in Swedish, but I intend to translate a few of the stories. Currently trying to mull over the final assignment: one that either has strong feel of magical realism, or that (harder) will use what Aristotles called Anagnorisis, that is: the main character makes a discovery that changes everything. Think Oedipus finding out that he'd fulfilled the prophecy, or Bruce Willis realising that he's dead in Sixth Sense. We'll see what I can come up with.

In case you haven't seen it, I've worked on the design for [antoniusm.se](https://antoniusm.se) lately. It includes using pictures and descriptions in the blog listing, pages for all posts under a specific tag/category, and a pager on each post to go to next/previous post. I'm also tweaking image sizes and slowly building up my "brand" and audience.

As for last time's writing plans:

* I'm letting *Angel Maker* rest at the moment, because I've been busy with other stuff. I think that with the current class, I'll go back to revise it with new eyes, as well as let it grow to at least 25k.
* Vide and Lo's story petered out, but I might pick it up later, since it's a very interesting idea
* Daily notes? Nope.
* Well. I did writing exercises in class. Does that count?

### Writing plans

* Occasionally update [Stockholm Sentinels](https://tablo.io/melindrea/stockholm-sentinels), a superhero story set in Stockholm (surprise!) and with a so-called diverse cast. It will mix supernatural abilities with the more mundane realities, since that's what I enjoy to write
* Give Helga a final revision, using all the tricks I learned in class, and then call that good enough
* See what of my writing class stories are worth keeping and expanding on

### Teaser

For this month here's the Zulu-Swedish paragon Spirit Hawk and the powerhouse Duality (with an undiagnosed auto-immune disease) meeting the openly gay energy controller Corona, from Stockholm Sentinels.

<blockquote>
Helena tumbled out of the cocoon and landed on the metal floor with a thud.  She rubbed at her shoulder and blinked awkwardly at the figure sitting in a wheelchair. Another person landed next to her, with talons the size of— actually, never mind the talons. Legs that went on forever, and broad hips.

“Thanks for saving me!” She drew a deep breath and savoured the sensation of not having her throat tickled with metallic netting. “I’m Corona, and who are you, gorgeous … I mean, who are you?”

“I’m Spirit Hawk, with she-pronouns, and this is Duality, with fey-pronounces.” The magnificent Spirit Hawk rubbed at her neck in what looked like an awkward habit.

“Fey-pronouns? Mine are she-pronouns, by the way.”

“Fey, feym, feir, feirs, feirself.” Duality spoke with a voice that lacked lustre, and feir face had ashen tones. “How did you end up in that cocoon?”

“The spiders finally caught up to me. I was dragged into the sphere when I touched it, and then I dodged the guards.”

“Okay, so we need to watch out for spiders. I’m assuming automata ones?” Spirit Hawk waited for the quick nod before continuing. “Do you know anything about the opening and closing of the doors?”

“Yes, it’s regular. Most of them open every 15th or 30th tick or so. You didn’t happen to find an exit, did you?”

“Not yet.” Spirit Hawk shook her head and bit into her lip. “Duality, was this enough rest to continue, or …?”

Duality opened feir mouth to speak, with every movement showing exhaustion. Even feir eyes looked tired.

“You know, if you all need to rest, we can camp here. I’ll take the first shift, and then you can take the second, Spirit Hawk.”

“That would actually be lovely.” A faint smile flickered over Duality’s pale features, before it turned into a grimace. “I … hate to ask, but can either of you help me.” Fey winced. “I ache all over.”

“Of course.” Spirit Hawk walked up to the wheelchair. “Put you on the ground, or …?”

As the other two discussed sleeping arrangements on the solid floor, Helena made herself comfortable with her legs crossed underneath her. She rested back on her arms and stared out into the bluish void dotted with metallic wheels and cogs. The air was still, as if it never moved, and soon the only sounds that disrupted the silence was the occasional tick and the light wheezing of Spirit Hawk and the rhythmic snoring of Duality. One wrapped up in her cape, the other in feir jacket that had been stuffed underneath the seat of the wheelchair.

Helena flicked a spark of electricity between her hands and watched it fly in arcs between her fingers. The power hummed in her, even here where everything was powered with clockwork. She extended her senses, probing for anything to play with.
