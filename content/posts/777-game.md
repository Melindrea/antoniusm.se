Writing game time! This time I was tagged by [Jette Harris](https://jetterfly.wordpress.com/2016/08/11/777-game/), a Twitter friend of mine. The 777 game wants me to post 7 lines from page 7 of the current work in progress and to tag 7 authors to do the same.

The excerpt is from a yet-unnamed WIP, an erotic thriller situated in a closed-down mental hospital being renovated.

> "Yeah, sure." She bit into a sandwich. "I'll call my friend at the library this afternoon. Maybe she's got some other stuff about this place. I mean, I didn't know about this place before I took the job."

> The others murmured their assent. While it should comfort Sol, one thought gnawed at their mind: was it unknown because nothing bad had happened here. Or because it had been covered up?

In turn, I tag:
