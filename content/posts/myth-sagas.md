As some of you know, I'm taking a class in creative writing, focused on mythology, fairy tales and how to reference them to build depth into your stories. Yes, that sounds very pompous, but it isn't as bad as it sounds.

Every lesson (three hours every other week) we have assigned reading, and assigned writing. The writing is based on the lesson we just had, the reading on the lesson we are about to have. During class we discuss the reading and try to analyse it to figure out what it's really about ("I meant it was fuckin' blue", to quote a punchline). Afterwards we go through our classmates stories, giving good, bad, and ways to improve it.

In my class we're six students and the teacher, so it's generally good conversation. I think my favourite is the guy whose writing always drips with sarcasm and societal critique, with just a few penstrokes. Mixing the mundanely mundane with the absurd. The reading has been interesting so far. It includes the first chapter of Kafka's Metamorphoses, bits from Wittkop's The Necrophiliac, and similar texts showcasing particular areas to learn.

We've covered transformation, from a more absurd, overt style (Kafka) to did-they-or-didn't-they, other mythical motifs such as Challenging the Gods and Katabasis (a fancy term for descending into the underworld), and how to draw on images that give you so much for free.

Let's say that there is a scene with an apple being offered. What comes to mind? Maybe Snow White. Maybe Eve and the Serpent. Possibly ambrosia or fairy food, depending on what other trappings we see. Or when it comes to characters, let's say that we have an older person with one eye, and the face in shadows? It doesn't take much to give the suggestion of this being Oden, does it?

I think that's the thing that I love the most of what we've been learning: how to pick the right details to build layers in the story. Layers that may not be noticed by all, or maybe not even by most, but that I know are there, and which may help to influence the reader subconciously.
