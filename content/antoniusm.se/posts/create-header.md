The entire procedure is adapted from the "Age a photo" tutorial on [Mora-Photo](http://www.mora-foto.it/en/tutorials-gimp/all-tutorials.html), though I've simplified some steps. Since I have a set image size for headers, it also includes scaling and cropping, which the original tutorial does not cover.

## 1. Select the photo

Pick out a photod that you ***have the right to use***. Whether you buy it or get it from a free stock image site, or take it yourself doesn't matter, though double- and triple-check that you have the right to use it for what you are wanting to do. Ensure that you know how to credit the photographer.

It needs to be at last 1200px by 630px, though it is not bad if it's larger, since that'll give you some room to play.

For this I picked this mountain view from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/new?photo=uFIH95iOfJ4) by Martin Sattler. The original size is 5760x3840px, but it's been scaled down to 1037Ã—691px for ease of viewing.
