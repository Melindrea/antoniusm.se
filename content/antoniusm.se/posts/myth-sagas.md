As some of you know, I've taken a class in creative writing, focused on mythology, fairy tales and how to reference them to build depth into your stories. Yes, that sounds very pompous, but it isn't as bad as it sounds.

Every lesson (three hours every other week) we had assigned reading and writing. The writing was based on the lesson we just had, the reading on the lesson we were about to have. During class we discussed the reading and tried to analyse it to figure out what it was really about ("I meant it was fuckin' blue", to quote a punchline). Afterwards we went through our classmates stories, giving the good, the bad, and ways to improve it.

In my class we're six students and the teacher, so it's generally good conversation. I think my favourite was the guy whose writing always dripped with sarcasm and societal critique with just a few penstrokes. Mixing the mundanely mundane with the absurd. The reading was very interesting; it included the first chapter of Kafka's Metamorphoses, bits from Wittkop's The Necrophiliac, and similar texts showcasing particular areas to learn.

We covered metamorphoses, from a more absurd, overt style (Kafka) to did-they-or-didn't-they, other mythical motifs such as Challenging the Gods and Katabasis (a fancy term for descending into the underworld), and how to draw on images that give you so much for free.

Let's say that there was a scene with an apple being offered. What comes to mind? Maybe Snow White. Maybe Eve and the Serpent. Possibly ambrosia or fairy food, depending on what other trappings we see. Or when it comes to characters, let's say that we have an older person with one eye, and the face in shadows? It doesn't take much to give the suggestion of this being Oden, does it?

I think that's the thing that I love the most of what we learned: how to pick the right details to build layers in the story. Layers that may not be noticed by all, or maybe not even by most, but that we knew were there, and which may help to influence the reader subconciously.
